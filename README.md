#A small game with jQuery, Jasmine and Bootstrap  
This is a small programming exercise that was used as a recruitment test. The time frame was 2 - 3 days. I tried to implement it with `react.js` first but switched to jQuery after 1.5 days because I had no `react.js` know how at all and it took me too long to set up all the necessary frameworks and tools for the first time.
  
I chose a test-driven approach and wrote Jasmine unit tests for the implemented scenarios and rules. I also added 'negative' tests assuring that the tested functions fail correctly. They are marked with a '-' (hyphen) at the beginning of the description.

The game triggers events to change state and generate turns. Additionally, there are buttons to trigger functions manually. Look at the JavaScript console to see the execution flow.
    
Unfortunately, I could not complete the game because I was running out of time (after 1.5 days). Had I started with jQuery from the very beginning, I would have completed it most likely. However, I hope that it shows my proper approach and senior programming skills.
